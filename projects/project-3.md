What is National History Day? 
---
National History Day is a competition in which students from around the world compete by researching a historical topic and presenting it in one of four categories: paper, documentary, exhibit, or performance. Students in middle and high school can participate, and they can either compete individually or in a group. Students must place in school and affiliate competitions before they can move on to the national competition in Maryland. 

My partner and I made competed at the national national level competition for a documentary on the explorations, encounters, and exchange of Pop Art.
