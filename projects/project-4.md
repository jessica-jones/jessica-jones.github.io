A Bit About Books for Bows
---
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/icon.png">

Books for Bows is a marketplace for University of Hawaiâ€™i students to buy and sell textbooks. We are "Books for Bows" because we serve the Rainbow Warriors (AKA 'Bows) of the University of Hawai'i. Our web application allows UHM students to create listings for textbooks, as well as view all available listings for textbooks. 

Often times, the shopping for textbook can be confusing, difficult, and frustrating. Our app tries to address these concerns by providing a convenient marketplace that connects buyers and sellers, as well as providing course information for each textbook.  


Call Me Buttah, Because I'm On A Role:

The most significant role I had in this project was the design of the Landing page, header, and footer, as well as the creation of artwork for the website.

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/landing_stack.PNG">

I drew all the icons on the landing page, as well as the "No Cover Available" image and the icon (and by extension, the favicon). 
<div class="ui small rounded images">

  <img class="ui image" src="../images/b4b-stacks.png">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/b4b_no_cover_available.png">
</div>

I had a hand in creating some of the default data, as well as updating the [Books for Bows Information Page](https://books-for-bows.github.io/) as the project progressed. 


What did I learn?
