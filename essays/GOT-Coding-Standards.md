SPOILERS AHEAD!

Ever wanted to learn about coding standards by examining the botched ending of a TV show? We’ve GOT you covered! 

It’s hard to ignore that many fans are disappointed in how the writers of Game of Thrones (GOT) Daniel Brett Weiss and David Benioff (who shall be henceforth known as Dan and Dave) handled the eighth and final season. Remember the infamous [petition]( https://www.change.org/p/hbo-remake-game-of-thrones-season-8-with-competent-writers)? If that’s not enough proof, try searching google images for [‘bad writers’](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1PRFG_enUS807US834&biw=1396&bih=686&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=NdGNXf0onbrQ8Q-p4pr4AQ&q=bad+writers&oq=bad+writers&gs_l=img.3..0i67j0l5j0i30l2j0i5i30l2.1862.3690..3838...0.0..0.136.1329.0j11......0....1..gws-wiz-img.18wb33DS7sg&ved=0ahUKEwi9l_yr0_DkAhUdHTQIHSmxBh8Q4dUDCAc&uact=5) – images of Dan and Dave pop up. 

While software and TV shows might seem like totally different things, in the industry, both are created from team members and adhere to certain standards. Let's examine some of the hits and misses of the writers to understand more about coding standards. 



Tools

Dan and Dave underutilized the tools they were given. Many fans argue that the quality of GOT decreased after Dan and Dave moved farther and farther away from the source material (Season 5). However, they could have consulted the author George R. R. Martin himself for guidance; he even suggested that the show could run 13 seasons with the amount of content he had produced. HBO was also willing to produce 10 episodes for the last season; I’m sure that HBO would have been happy to coordinate help from other writers if necessary. 
When coding, you should take advantage of the tools you have at your disposal. Since there are so many IDEs and plugins that will not only suggest what to fix in your code but automatically format it for you, there is no excuse to not adhere to a coding standard.  

So What Now? Re-watchability and Readability

I think one of the biggest things Dan and Dave forgot to consider was the life and longevity of their project. While studios make money from the initial release of a TV show and merchandise, they also make money from residuals. If the popularity of a show persists beyond its release, whenever the show is re-run on TV or when streaming services buy the rights to host it on their platform, the people involved with the project still earn money. What Dan and Dave failed to realize is that they wasted the effort behind not only season 8, but the complete series. People aren’t going to want to invest in watching the entire series if they know the ending does not pay off. Again, all the effort put into the series by the rest of the team members – the actors, production team, editors, musicians, cinematography team, and the rest of the crew – is overshadowed by the bad writing. 
When writing code, one of the things you should consider is if your code stands the test of time. A couple of months from now, will you be able to understand the code you wrote? Are other people going to be able to easily read and understand it? Is this something people will be able to build upon or use in the future? Is there effort reflected in the final product?
