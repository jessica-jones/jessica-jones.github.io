Overview:

### Problem:
  UH consistantly has events going on campus. Events can interfere with parking/your schedule. How will you be able to adjust your commute or plan ahead if you don't know what's going on? Especially if these events don't pertain to you/you are the target demographic. 
  
  For example, if you aren't a sports fan, how will you know that the volleyball game will affect your commute home?  

### Solution:
  Our website keeps track of the events happening at UH, and will let you know if parking/traffic will be affected. You can input your schedule to our website and we will see what events will affect you, as well as which ones you can attend. Events can be tagged by what they affect, topics, and location. You can filter by these things.

 ### Mockup: 
 
* Landing page
* User home page
* Admin home page
* (Admin) Create Event page
* User Profile page
* All Events page 
* User Specific Events page

Use case ideas:
---

* New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile (select interests/input schedule). 
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, creates event posts.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page (curated feed of events). 


Beyond the basics:

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

* Use UH CAS Login instead of Meteor Login to guarantee that users are UH students.
* Map to show you where events are in relation to your schedule.
