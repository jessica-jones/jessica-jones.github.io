Problem:
---
  UH consistantly has events going on campus. Events can interfere with parking/your schedule. How will you be able to adjust your commute or plan ahead if you don't know what's going on? Especially if these events don't pertain to you/you are the target demographic. 


Solution:
---
  Our website keeps track of the events happening at UH, and will let you know if parking/traffic will be affected. You can input your schedule to our website and we will see what events will affect you, as well as which ones you can attend.
