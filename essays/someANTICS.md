Learning Semantic UI through the Framework of Modern Art and Consumerism 


A User-Interface (UI) framework is a tool that provides the structure/template for constructing complex applications without extensive technical or design skills. There are many reasons why someone would want to use one of them…
Speaking specifically about Semantic UI, which we used for class: 
-	It’s Efficient: it saves developers from unnecessarily building components from scratch 
-	It’s Cost Effective: it’s free to use, you don’t have to hire a professional to implement it, and there’s also a dedicated team of people working on it/fixing bugs 
-	It’s Helpful: it includes a lot of functions that I wouldn’t know how to make on my own such as the search bar/drop down menu 
-	It’s Got Tons of Documentation 


But talking to my classmates, I was surprised to find that many of them don’t like HTML or using Semantic UI -- they thought that it was frivolous to learn. The discussion around the seriousness of learning to use a UI framework and how it related to other languages and skills made me think about how people view and contextualize modern artwork. About how when Andy Warhol put mass-produced, ordinary, commercial items into the context of a museum, he transformed them into art; or at the very least, sparked a conversation about what art was.

Onement VI by Barnett Newman. Beyond money laundering, why would someone purchase this for $43.8 million dollars. When simple works of art like this one are bought, it makes us wonder, what even is art? 

Even earlier this week, there was hubbub around Martin Scorsese’s [view of the Marvel movies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2019/10/10/the-real-problem-with-martin-scorseses-marvel-comments/); how he didn’t consider them to be ‘cinema’. Assertions like these are often seen as elitist. Certainly there are norms that the Marvel movies or modern art challenge; can we understand the unwillingness to learn and reluctance to take UI seriously through such a lens?

One concern my classmate have with learning to use Semantic UI is that it takes a lot of time to learn. Helpful as it is, there is a lot of documentation to go through. In their eyes, mastering Semantic is not a necessary skill. You can make a fully functional webpage without it. In fact, the changes you make to your website don't necessarily make it stand out - it follows the format and uses the same things as just about any other website. Why put all this time and effort into something you don't really need, and aren't planning on using in the future? I think that it's a fair question to ask; should you be expected to know or be good at everything concerning software development?
 
I think by examining the concerns my classmates have, we can better understant their perspectives and where their priorities lie. I thought maybe they didn't like Semantic UI because it was unfamiliar or difficult to use. But then I realized; there are a lot of basic apps and programs that these people run with ugliness and poor documentation. I think my classmates are focused on practicality; they encorporate tools that work/dont NEED to be pretty. They want to focus on the problem itself. 


What they’re missing is that semantic UI esp. resembles a huge part of people’s experience with the web. 
I think they don’t realize how closely technology is linked to ppl. Technology is linked to people – we create solutions for the problems people create. Ray Bradbury was good at predicting things not bc he was good at tech but because he was good at understanding people.
Maybe it’s a rebellion from the commercialization/mold/our growing fatigue of reboots and formulaic movies (ads in entertainment – YouTube, tv, product placement in movies/music videos). Constant bombardment 

Good marketing is not necessarily indicative of a good product. 


McDonald’s v Michelin Stars

I think its fine to learn as a (complement) if you are pursuing computer science 
Don’t think it should be the focus of software development (like the foundation) Is McDonald’s the same as a Michelin Starred restaurant? They are both food. It’s fine to enjoy every once and a while – not real life, has a superficial purpose (it’s not substance sustenance) -doesn’t make it bad. 
The substance is most important I think; if everything looks the same anyway, they are going to be judging the content (pretty will only get you so far). If the software doesn’t work, there are plenty of people willing to use things that don’t look as good. 

Marvel makes movies, but it’s not cinema. The distinction that Scorsese is making is accurate. Cinema is not overly focused on what the audience how to them. It’s not making narrative decisions based on committee or test audiences or future franchise potential. Cinema is a director’s medium, not a studio’s medium. I wish people could be more nuanced and less literal about recognizing the distinction Scorese is making.

ust as our tastes change from day to day, ie: whether we prefer steak one day and pizza the next, both style of movies are valid. All of us want what accentuates our experiences whether it be gritty or surreal. Validates our experiences 

Marvel cinematic universe isn’t not cinema; its just not GOOD cinema; they are underutilizing the tools available to them. 


Choosing to Suck

I think technology and people go hand in hand; I think it’s generally helpful to learn to consider the people using the technology you create. I think the foundation should be good content; dressing it up is a bonus but vital in this day and age. Important to use well. I think if anything it speaks to the prevalence of commercial in our lives.

I think my classmates are right, in a way. There’s no need to make it out to be more than it is. It’s fine if it’s just a way of giving their plain html a makeover.  
What does this mean going forward? 


I think this quote from Homeland by Cory Doctorow is apt. The main character is comparing (his parents losing their jobs, struggling to get through school) to a friend’s jetsetting life (on the run). 
“Her reality might suck too, but it sucked in huge, showy, neon letters—not in the quiet, crabbed handwriting of a desperate and broke teenager scribbling in his diary.”  From Homeland by Cory Doctorow 

No matter what it is, you want your website to suck in huge, showy, neon letters (cool suck). 
Struggle, work, create
