Learning Semantic UI through the Framework of Modern Art and Consumerism 


A User-Interface (UI) framework is a tool that provides the structure/template for constructing complex applications without extensive technical or design skills. There are many reasons why someone would want to use one of them…
Speaking specifically about Semantic UI, which we used for class: 
-	It’s Efficient: it saves developers from unnecessarily building components from scratch 
-	It’s Cost Effective: it’s free to use, you don’t have to hire a professional to implement it, and there’s also a dedicated team of people working on it/fixing bugs 
-	It’s Helpful: it includes a lot of functions that I wouldn’t know how to make on my own such as the search bar/drop down menu 
-	It’s Got Tons of Documentation 


But talking to my classmates, I was surprised to find that many of them don’t like HTML or using Semantic UI -- they thought that it was frivolous to learn. The discussion around the seriousness of learning to use a UI framework and how it related to other languages and skills made me think about how people view and contextualize modern artwork. About how when Andy Warhol put mass-produced, ordinary, commercial items into the context of a museum, he transformed them into art; or at the very least, sparked a conversation about what art was. 

Even earlier this week, there was hubbub around Martin Scorsese’s [view of the Marvel movies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2019/10/10/the-real-problem-with-martin-scorseses-marvel-comments/); how he didn’t consider them to be ‘cinema’. Assertions like these are often seen as elitist. Certainly, there are norms that the Marvel movies or modern art challenge; can we understand the unwillingness to learn and reluctance to take UI seriously through such a lens? 


Pop Art Stop Art

One concern my classmate have with learning to use Semantic UI is that it takes a lot of time to learn. Helpful as it is, there is a lot of documentation to go through. In their eyes, mastering Semantic is not a necessary skill. You can make a fully functional webpage without it. In fact, the changes you make to your website don't necessarily make it stand out - it follows the format and uses the same things as just about any other website. Why put all this time and effort into something you don't really need, and aren't planning on using in the future? I think that it's a fair question to ask; should you be expected to know or be good at everything concerning software development?
 
I think by examining the concerns my classmates have, we can better understand their perspectives and where their priorities lie. I thought maybe they didn't like Semantic UI because it was unfamiliar or difficult to use. But then I realized; there are a lot of basic apps and programs that these people run with ugliness and poor documentation. I think my classmates are focused on practicality; they incorporate tools that work/don't NEED to be pretty. They want to focus on the problem itself. 

However, I think they're missing that Semantic UI is set up to mirror the experience people have while using the web. That, and technology is closely linked to people. After all, tech is the solution to the problems that people create. 

McDonald’s v Michelin Stars

In support of Marvel movies, fans have rebutted Scorsese that movies are cinema– it plays in a theater, doesn’t it? However, I think that they need to be more nuanced and less literal about the distinction Scorsese is making; is McDonald’s the same as a Michelin Starred restaurant? They both make food. 

Marvel movies are a studio project, whose creative choices are dictated based on money making potential. Cinema reflects the creative vision of the director, not future franchise establishing.  With fast food, it's okay to occasionally eat it from time to time. The real problem is when you only ever eat it. Similarly, I think it’s fine to dabble in UI. However, this shouldn't be the foundation of your programming knowledge; it should just complement it.  

The substance is most important I think; if everything looks the same anyway, the audience is going to be judging the content anyway. If the software doesn’t work, there are plenty of people willing to use things that don’t look as good. 


Choosing to Suck

I think technology and people go hand in hand; I think it’s generally helpful to learn to consider the people using the technology you create. I think the foundation should be good content; using Semantic UI or another UI Framework to dress it up is a bonus but vital in this day and age.

I think my classmates are right, in a way. There’s no need to make it out to be more than it is. It’s fine if it’s just a way of giving their plain html a makeover.  

What does this mean going forward? 

I think this quote from Homeland by Cory Doctorow is apt. The main character is comparing the events that have recently happened in his life – his parents losing their jobs, struggling to afford college – to a friend who is traveling around the world to escape the law: 

> “Her reality might suck too, but it sucked in huge, showy, neon letters—not in the quiet, crabbed handwriting of a desperate and broke teenager scribbling in his diary.” 

If you are going to suffer making a website, you might as well take it all the way and use Semantic UI to make it huge, showy, and neon, as opposed to quiet and crabbed.
