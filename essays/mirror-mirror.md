### Ethics 
> “I think the hardest thing for anyone is accepting that other people are as real as you are. That’s it. Not using them as tools, not using them as examples or things to make yourself feel better or things to get over or under.” – Zadie Smith

I'm glad I took software engineering this semester. It helped me to have a "new awareness of ~~what the internet does to us~~ what we as designers, developers, and entrepreneurs do to each other." We are the ones pulling the strings; our code isn’t simply utilitarian (it serves a purpose), it also reflects the values that we have.
