While taking Computer Science courses, I’ve heard people make claims about which programming language is the best. Some say Python, some say C++, some say JavaScript. 
While learning JavaScript, I started reflecting on my personal experience with learning different programming languages, as well as thinking about what makes people chose to praise one programming language over the other. 

Learning the language:
---
I think how you were exposed to a language can influence your preference of programming language. In my software engineering class, we are practicing though timed exercises called WODs. This athletic approach is definitely a lot more enjoyable than trying to learn from an ancient textbook. It also makes sense - you can read all the theory in the world about karate, but unless you go through the drills day after day, you will never become a black belt. Same with programming. WODs are also a good way to monitor your improvement; you need to have a solid enough grasp of certain concepts to complete the assignment, and you can use your time as a quantitative measurement of progress. I can see this contributing to a sense of confidence in my ability as a programmer – which I don’t get from reading alone. I can also see this practice coming in handy during job interviews; if I need to complete a timed assignment, I will feel more confident knowing that I have had plenty of practice.  

Tools:

This doesn’t really relate to the programming languages themselves, but I think it is still worth mentioning. One of the things that certainly helped shape my experience programing are the tools I used. My

So why would someone like C?

Having learned C/C++, I can say with confidence that JavaScript is a lot easier to learn and use. You don’t have to know much about how computer memory works to code in JS, not to the degree that you would to code in C++. There are certain quirks in JavaScript that I like: I like how you can compare not only the value of a variable but the type (using ===), as well as simplify functions.

Some programming languages such as C/C++ give you more control over what you do, but as the Spiderman proverb goes, “with great power comes great responsibility”.  Simply because you can compile something doesn’t mean that it will work like you intended; you have to 
Is suffering better? Does it make you a better programmer, worthy etc if you suffer? 
For ppl who are new-ish its approachable

Closing Remarks:  I think it comes down to what you are using it for and personal preference.
